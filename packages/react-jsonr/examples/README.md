# React-JSONR Examples

This directory contains examples demonstrating various features of the React-JSONR library. These examples are meant to showcase usage patterns and implementation techniques rather than being imported and used directly in applications.

## Available Examples

1. **Basic Rendering** (`basic-rendering.tsx`)  
   Demonstrates how to render JSON definitions to React components.

2. **Component Transformation** (`component-transformation.tsx`)  
   Shows how to transform component nodes in the JSON tree before rendering.

3. **Dynamic Form** (`dynamic-form.tsx`)  
   Demonstrates how to create and modify form structures dynamically.

4. **Conditional Rendering** (`conditional-rendering.tsx`)  
   Shows how to conditionally render components based on application state.

5. **Primitive Transforms** (`primitive-transforms.tsx`)  
   Demonstrates how to transform primitive values (strings, numbers, etc.) in the JSON tree.

## Learning from the Examples

Each example is designed to be a reference implementation showcasing specific features of React-JSONR:

- Learn about the basic structure of JSON component definitions
- Understand how to create and use transform visitors
- See how to integrate with React state and event handling
- Explore patterns for dynamic UI generation

The examples include detailed comments explaining key concepts and implementation details. You can use these patterns as a guide for implementing similar functionality in your own applications.

## Running the Examples

These examples are primarily for reference and study. If you want to run or experiment with them, you can:

1. Copy the relevant code sections into your project
2. Reference the implementation patterns in your own code
3. Use them as a starting point for your own implementations

Each example is self-contained and demonstrates a complete implementation pattern.
