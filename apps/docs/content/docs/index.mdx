description: A plugin-based component renderer for React
---

React JSONR is a lightweight, extensible library that converts JSON definitions into React components. With a powerful plugin-based transformation layer and support for asynchronous processing, React JSONR enables you to build dynamic UIs driven by JSON dataâ€”while maintaining security, performance, and ease of use.

## Features

- **JSON-to-React Conversion**: Transform a JSON description of a UI into a fully-rendered React element tree
- **Plugin-Based Transformation**: Insert synchronous or asynchronous plugins to mutate, enrich, or validate the JSON tree before rendering
- **Interactive Traversal**: Use generator functions to inspect and modify nodes during traversal with fine-grained control
- **Flexible Traversal**: Supports configurable traversal orders with options to skip subtrees
- **Component Registry**: Uses a whitelist of allowed component types, ensuring that only registered components are rendered
- **Event Handler Mapping**: Safely maps string-based event handler references to actual functions provided by your application
- **Performance Optimizations**: Designed to handle moderately large JSON trees efficiently
- **Zero External Dependencies**: Built with React (>= v18) and TypeScript, with minimal overhead
